This reppository contains a draft of an article describing a complex simulation for the peopling of the Americas. Unfortunately, the complexity grew beyond what I could handle, so I had to give up on it â€“ I am happy for someone else using part or all of these documents as a quarry for their own projects, though.

To facilitate that, you can use text and code under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md#mit-license) or ![CC-BY](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png).

In addition to the main, highly complex, simulation, the repository contains some Python re-implementations of other models that informed the design choices.
