Model Description
=================

This model description follows the ODD (Overview, Design concept, Details)
protocol (Grimm et al., 2006; Grimm et al., 2010). The model description
follows the idea of literate programming (Knuth 1992) to the extent useful in
an IPython Notebook â€“ the actual model is generated from this file that
documents the model, but the source code is largely commented using
natural-language descriptions, not generated from them (as would be the case
in a literal program).

# 1. Purpose

The settlement model generates a deep phylogeny of hunter-gatherer cultures
based on culture-mediated cooperation and resource-driven migration. It is a
demographic migration model in which the areal distribution of languages is
an emergent property, not an imposed structure.

The summary statistics of this phylogeny (in particular diversification
rates) are to be compared to values known from language evolution. The model
is structured to be easily applied to study the history of the settlement of
the Americas at a later time. It would requires paleoclimate data to produce
results that can be compared to that history.
