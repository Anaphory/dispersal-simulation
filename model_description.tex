\section{Introduction}
Agent-Based Models (ABM) \parencite{} can be a useful tool for the investigation
of complex systems not otherwise accessible to the researcher \parencite{}. One
area of application for agent-based simulations is in theoretical biology and
adjacent fielnds, where experiments cannot be conducted due to the scales
involved. ABMs have been fruitfully applied to study the evolution of
cooperation \parencite{}, culture \parencite{}. In the wider historical
sciences, ABMs can help archeologists interpret scarce data
\parencite{cegielski2016rethinking}.

In historical linguistics, simulation and other highly computational methods
have only become part of the toolbox, starting with the availability of big
cross-linguistic databases and methods taken over from bioinformatics
\parencite{}. In this field, Agent-Based Models have been applied to study very
specific linguistic changes
\cite{bloem2015agentbased,feltgen2017modeling,grim2011simulating,radulescu2016modelling,vantrijp2016evolution}
or extremely abstract, focussing on evolutionary dynamics
\cite{arita1998evolution,castello2013agentbased,javarone2014competitive}.
However, the statistical methodology applied eg. by studies of language
phylogeny largely fall into two camps: Many models are taken over from
biological evolution and insufficiently grounded in linguistic reality. Others
are justified by mathematical simplicity, but have not been tested for
linguistic realism either. ABMs, as bottom-up simulations which other more
abstract statistical methods can be validated against, will help bridge the gap
between small-scale linguistic processes and large-scale statistical analyses.

In this article, we present an Agent-Based Model in which areas of coherent
culture or language arise from low-level demographic and migratory processes.
The model provides a first step towards understanding the patterns of language
diversification, spread, and extinction. These processes are important factors
in the large-scale dynamics of language evolution. They directly inform the
shape of tree priors in Bayesian phylogenetics, which are currently heavily
relying on theoretical biology (for coalescent and birth/death priors) or
reduced to maximum mathematical simplicity (in the case of uniform tree priors)
and have some influence on inferred tree topologies and dates
\cite{rama2018three}.

The structure of this article is as follows. In \cref{s:earlier}, we provide an
overview over existing models that were considered in the construction of the
present model, and which of their elements were included into our model.
\Cref{s:odd} provides the model description according to the revised ODD
protocol \parencite{grimm2006standard,grimm2010odd}, generated using literate
programming techniques \parencite{knuth1984literate} from the Rust \parencite{}
source code of the simulation. We summarize our parameter choices in
\cref{s:parameters}. In \cref{s:results} we present the results from the various
runs of the simulation with the aforementioned parameter settings. We discuss
our results in \cref{s:discussion}. The paper finishes with conclusions in
\cref{s:conclusions}.
