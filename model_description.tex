\section{Introduction}
Global cultural diversity provides us with a unique window into the past, and
“any reduction of language diversity diminishes the adaptational strength of our
species because it lowers the pool of knowledge from which we can draw”
(Bernard, 1992:82). %Says Daria, my Bachelor student. So I got at least
                    %something out of her thesis ;)
Of particular interest are thus remnants of language diversity before the
wide-spread colonization of the world by European nations. Several recent
studies
\parencite{gavin2017processbased,pachecocoelho2019drivers,hua2019ecological}
consider ecological factors for language diversity. These studies so far stay
largely on the phenomenological level, estimating extant language diversity from
various ecological predictors and finding areas of surprisingly high or low
language diversity. The processes that drive diversity on these scales, on the
basis of small-scale human interactions, however, are not understood.

Agent-Based Models (ABM) \parencite{} can be a useful tool for the investigation
of complex systems not otherwise accessible to the researcher \parencite{}. One
area of application for agent-based simulations is in theoretical biology and
adjacent fields, where experiments cannot be conducted due to the scales
involved. ABMs have been fruitfully applied to study the evolution of
cooperation \parencite{}, culture \parencite{}. In the wider historical
sciences, ABMs can help archeologists and paleontolgists interpret scarce data
\parencite{cegielski2016rethinking,barcelo2016simulating}.

In historical linguistics, simulation and other highly computational methods
have only recently become part of the toolbox, starting with the availability of big
cross-linguistic databases and methods taken from bioinformatics
\parencite{}. In this field, Agent-Based Models have been applied to study very
specific linguistic changes
\cite{bloem2015agentbased,feltgen2017modeling,grim2011simulating,radulescu2016modelling,vantrijp2016evolution}
or extremely abstract, focussing on evolutionary dynamics
\cite{arita1998evolution,castello2013agentbased,javarone2014competitive}.
However, the statistical methodology applied eg.\ by studies of language
phylogeny largely fall into two camps: Many models are taken over from
biological evolution and insufficiently grounded in linguistic reality. Others
are justified by mathematical simplicity, but have not been tested for
linguistic realism either. ABMs, as bottom-up simulations which other more
abstract statistical methods can be validated against, will help bridge the gap
between small-scale linguistic processes and large-scale statistical analyses.

In this article, we present an Agent-Based Model in which the spatial
distribution of languages on the continent scale, in the shape of realistically
sized areas with internally language, arise from low-level demographic and
migratory processes. 
While various models combining two of the relevant aspects exist and a small
number of models combining three of the aspects, we incorporates all four of
geography, culture, migration, and demographics in a bottom-up model.
In particular, our model permits a dynamic equilibrium, where the entire
geographic space is populated, but migration and language change continue to
form the linguistic landscape.
\emph{Previous literature is the one in \cref{s:earlier} – Each needs to be
  classified by which topics it touches on and which are missing.}

As such, our model provides a first step towards understanding the patterns of
language diversification, spread, and extinction. These processes are important
factors in the large-scale dynamics of language evolution, and a computational
model will thus contribute to our understanding of the causes and factors of
linguistic diversity.
In addition, these factors directly inform the
shape of tree priors in Bayesian phylogenetics. This burgeoning field
\parencite{jager,bouckaert,gray,sino-tibetan} grew from the application of
bioinformatics tools to linguistic data. As such, the methodology still heavily
relies on theoretical biology (for coalescent and birth/death priors) or reduced
to maximum mathematical simplicity (in the case of uniform tree priors). Our
model could be used to assess tree priors, which have some influence on inferred
tree topologies and dates \cite{rama2018three}, and generally contribute to the
current push for more linguistic models in language phylogenetics
\parencite{stochasticdollo,dollowithlateraltransfers,neureiter,maurits-rakes,kaiping-tap,kaiping-burstclock}.

Being a first step in this direction, the model presented here has three major restrictions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the model, we focus on the processes that drive the spatial
  distribution of cultures only for hunter-gatherers. Horticulture and
  agriculture have been developed independently in many parts of the world
  \parencite{} and thus directly or indirectly influenced cultural diversity in
  most parts of the world. However, this development is somewhat recent in the
  scope of human history. More importantly for the purposes of this initial
  model, agriculture would vastly increase the complexity of the model, because
  it would add a feedback loop between culture and carrying capacity. This
  additional complexity will be necessary for a full model of language
  dispersal, but in order to piece apart the various influences, an iterative
  approach will be necessary and we start with the simpler model.
\item We include no complex model of culture: Cultural features in a binary
  vector (which supports evolutionary drift) is completely separate from the
  between-group strategy of agents and from the adaptation to ecosystems.
  There is not sufficient quantitative evidence to create a general model of
  these three aspects of culture, and any such attempt would distract from the
  model's focus and reduce its speed.
\end{enumerate}

As a summary, we construct a demographic migration model which includes culture.
The model is designed with extension to more concrete research questions in
mind. In the current, first stage, the purpose of the model is to investigate
how languages disperse and split.

The structure of this article is as follows. The following section provides the model
description according to the revised ODD protocol
\parencite{grimm2006standard,grimm2010odd}, a top-down description protocol for
agent-based models starting with an overview and ending with the details of
individual submodels. We summarize our parameter choices in \cref{s:parameters}.
In \cref{s:results} we present the results from the various runs of the
simulation with the aforementioned parameter settings. We discuss our results in
\cref{s:discussion}. The paper finishes with conclusions in
\cref{s:conclusions}.

\emph{In \cref{s:earlier}, we provide an overview over existing models that were
  considered in the construction of the present model, and which of their
  elements were included into our model. This section well be re-worked into the
  various sections, in particular the ‘submodels’ section, of the ODD, and is
  only a separate section because it was circulated independently for review.}
